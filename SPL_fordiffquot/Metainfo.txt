Published in:		Statistical Programming Languages

Description:		'The Quantlet generates a data set that based on the mathematical theory of the forward difference
			quotient. In detail, the Quantlet caclutates data of the absolute approximation and their absolute
			error of the first derivation f'(x) of the cosine function f(x)=cos(x) at the position x=1 for
			several different increment parameters h. More exactly, the Quantlet generates a tabular overview
			of the following characteristic factors:

			- increment
			- approximation
			- error
			
			The generated table shows the most exactly approximation of |f'(1)| of the cosine function which
			can be calculated by the programming language R in line 8 and the mathematical order of error of
			the forward difference quotient in line 1 to 8 (linear relationship between increment and error).
			Furthermore, the Quantlet creates a graphical representation of the order of error.'
