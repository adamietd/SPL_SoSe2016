NAME OF QUANTLET:	SPL_symdiffquot

PUBLISHED IN:		Statistical Programming Languages

DESCRIPTION:		'The Quantlet generates a data set that based on the mathematical theory of the symmetric
			difference quotient. In detail, the Quantlet caclutates data of the absolute approximation and
			their absolute error of the first derivation f'(x) of the cosine function f(x)=cos(x) at the
			position x=1 for several different increment parameters h. More exactly, the Quantlet generates a
			tabular overview of the following characteristic factors:

			- increment
			- approximation
			- error
			
			The generated table shows the most exactly approximation of |f'(1)| of the cosine function which
			can be calculated by the programming language R in line 5 and the mathematical order of error of
			the symmetric difference quotient in line 1 to 5 (quadratic relationship between increment and
			error). Furthermore, the Quantlet creates two graphical representations of the order of error.'
